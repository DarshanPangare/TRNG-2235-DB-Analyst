    "#### Three Types of Principals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Users**  \n",
    "   - Human users who access the Databricks platform via UI, API, or CLI.  \n",
    "   - Typically assigned individual roles and permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Service Principals**  \n",
    "   - Non-human identities used for automation, integrations, or external tools.  \n",
    "   - Allow programmatic access with specific permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Account Groups**  \n",
    "   - Logical collections of users and/or service principals.  \n",
    "   - Simplifies permission management by assigning rights at group level rather than individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Object Ownership and Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every object in Databricks (tables, views, notebooks, clusters, etc.) has an **owner**.  \n",
    "- Owners control permissions on their objects and can delegate access.  \n",
    "- Permissions define allowed actions such as **READ**, **WRITE**, **MANAGE**, **EXECUTE**.  \n",
    "- Permissions can be granted at different scopes forming a hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Permissions Hierarchy for Data Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Catalog** (top-level container for schemas and tables)  \n",
    "- **Schema** (namespace for tables and views)  \n",
    "- **Table/View** (data objects)  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Permissions flow down the hierarchy but can be overridden at lower levels for fine-grained control.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Permissions on Non-Data Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Databricks also controls access to compute and workspace assets beyond data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Notebooks**  \n",
    "  - Permissions control who can **view**, **edit**, **run**, or **manage** notebooks.  \n",
    "  - Owners can share notebooks selectively to control collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clusters**  \n",
    "  - Permissions include who can **create**, **start**, **restart**, **terminate**, or **manage** cluster configurations.  \n",
    "  - Prevents unauthorized resource usage and cost overruns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Jobs**  \n",
    "  - Control who can **create**, **edit**, **run**, or **manage** scheduled jobs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Libraries**  \n",
    "  - Permissions determine who can **install** or **manage** libraries on clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sharing and Grants\n",
    "\n",
    "- Databricks supports **fine-grained access control** via grants to principals.  \n",
    "- Permissions are explicit and auditable.  \n",
    "- Unity Catalog enables data sharing across accounts and workspaces without duplicating data.  \n",
    "- Shares allow consumers to query data securely with access controls managed by providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Principle of Least Privilege\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always grant **only the minimum permissions necessary** for a user or service to perform their job.  \n",
    "- Reduces risk of accidental or malicious data exposure or system misuse.  \n",
    "- Regularly review and audit permissions to ensure compliance with least privilege.\n",
